<h4 style="color:white">Alobijod Cove Beach Resort</h4>
<p style="color:white">Though it lacks the immaculate white sand of beaches in Boracay or Palawan, Alobijod Beach in the island state of Guimaras is still charming. The beach's cream-colored sand, blue-tinged waves, and scattered rock formations are all scenic in and of themselves. Unwind, rest, and take a tricycle rental to tour the island or take a boat to see neighboring sights.
